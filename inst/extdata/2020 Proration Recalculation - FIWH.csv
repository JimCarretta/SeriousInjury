WHALE WAS OBSERVED FALLING OFF THE BOW IN THE TURNING CHANNEL NEAR OAKLAND. ON 5/18/2018 THE MARINE MAMMAL CENTER RECEIVED A REPORT REGARDING A DECEASED WHALE PARTIALLY SUBMERGED, WEDGED BETWEEN POSTS AND PINNED UNDERNEATH A BRIDGE NEAR OAKLAND. ON 5/18,  WHALE WAS TOWED TO ANGEL ISLAND FOR A NECROPSY. TWO VERTEBRAE OF THE UPPER LUMBAR REGION WERE DISPLACED 90 DEGREES FROM THE REMAINING LUMBAR VERTEBRAE. THE INTERVERTEBRAL DISC AND LIGAMENTOUS SUPPORT WERE COMPLETELY RUPTURED.  DEGREE OF DISPLACEMENT WOULD SURELY HAVE SEVERED THE SPINAL CORD.  NOTE THAT SINCE WHALE WAS TOWED BY TAIL, DEGREE OF ACTUAL DISPLACEMENT MAY HAVE BEEN REDUCED DURING TOWING (WHICH TENDS TO STRAIGHTEN SPINE).  SEVERAL PLATES OF BROKEN BONE WERE FOUND BELONGING TO THE SPINOUS PROCESSES AND LATERAL PROCESSES OF THESE TWO DISPLACED VERTEBRAE AS WELL AS FROM APPROXIMATELY THREE ADJACENT VERTEBRAE (AT LEAST FIVE VERTEBRAE WERE INVOLVED, POSSIBLY MORE).  THE DISPLACED VERTEBRAE WERE PUSHED AGAINST THE LAST TWO RIBS OF THE RIGHT SIDE.  THIS DISPLACEMENT INDICATES THE IMPACT FROM THE RIGHT SIDE PUSHED WELL PAST THE MIDLINE OF THE WHALE, DISPLACING THE VERTEBRAE FROM THE MIDLINE TO THE LEFT SIDE.",VS,MT,DEAD,,0,,,NA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,
